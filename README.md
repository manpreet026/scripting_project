Command Line Shell
Shell can be accessed by users using a command line interface.
A special program called Terminal in Linux/macOS, or Command Prompt in Windows OS is provided to type in the human-readable commands such as “cat”, “ls” etc. and then it is being executed. 
The result is then displayed on the terminal to the user.
